# Krateo PlatformOps Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to Krateo PlatformOps. Together, we will:

* Install Krateo PlatformOps into a local or managed Kubernetes cluster.

### Starting a Local Cluster

Any of the following approaches require [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) v3.13.1 or
greater to be installed.

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

If you have any Docker-compatible container runtime installed (including native
Docker, Docker Desktop, or OrbStack), you can easily launch a disposable cluster
just for this quickstart using
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/#installation-and-usage).

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateo/releases/latest/download/kind.sh | sh
```

:::info
While this option is a bit more complex than using Docker Desktop or OrbStack
directly, it offers the advantage of being fully-disposable. If your cluster
reaches a state you are dissatisfied with, you can simply destroy it and
launch a new one.

At the end of this process:

* The Krateo Composable Portal will be accessible at [localhost:30080](https://localhost:30080).

## Cleaning up

Congratulations! You've just gotten hands on with Kargo for the first time!

Now let's clean up!

<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

Simply destroy the cluster:

```shell
kind delete cluster --name krateo-quickstart
```
